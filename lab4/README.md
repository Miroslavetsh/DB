## Steps to run MEAN app using docker-compose locally

- Firstly, clone this repo to your working directory
- Secondly, open a **_/lab4_** folder
- Thirdly, run `docker compose up` or `docker-compose up --build`

I've defined a Dockerfile for each part of application, so You can just run `docker compose up` command, after that you will see an app by following [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). Otherwise, if only you won't see the website, try [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) instead
